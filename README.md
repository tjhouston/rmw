Remember my warranty is a simple project by TJ Houston & Scott Krieder to learn meteor.js.

### Problem

So many times we found that we would purchase warranties on products and either never use them or if we did need to use them we would never have the required purchase info. 
With RMW we seek to change this and keep track of purchase dates and receipts and even send automated emails to remind us when our warranties will be up. 

### Next Steps
*Image upload of receipts

*Email reminders

*Full responsive site

*Dashboard

*Email verification
