  <h1>About</h1>
  <p> RMW was a project that Scott Krieder and TJ Houston had brainstormed back in 2010. Now in 2014 it has come to life. RMW is a simple utility that keeps track of your warrenties for you. It solves the problem of keeping track of all of your receipts and warrenty information. Hope you enjoy it and find it useful! </p>
